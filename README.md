# Combine-Multiple-Sheets
This will get the data from multiple google sheets and combine them into a single spreadsheet. 

This project was build to get the data from multiple rosters saved on different google sheets with the purpose of having them all combined into a single sheet.
Once the data is all collected, it will be sorted in ascending order according to the employee number which is unique for every employee. After the sorting is completed
some of the lines of data will be highlighted with a greyish colour for better readability.
